Developing a plugin like this one takes a _lot_ of time.  Thankfully, I've been able to use it on paying projects to help offset the cost.

If you have found this plugin helpful and you're using it on your site, please consider thanking me financially by

Thank you!

If you are hankering to see new features integrated into this plugin, please consider hiring me: that's the best way to ensure that I give this plugin the same attention to detail that I give to my paying projects.
