# Standard Installation #

Installing the CCTM is the same as installing other WordPress plugins.  You can install it from the WordPress manager by navigating to the **Plugins" menu and clicking the "Add New" button.  Activate the plugin once you have downloaded it.**

# Manual Installation #

  1. Download a .zip file of the plugin.  See the [Downloads](Downloads.md) page for how to download a .zip file of the plugin (including the latest development version).
  1. If possible, upload the .zip file to your web server and unzip it to the `wp-content/plugins/` directory.  If you cannot unzip files on your web server, then unzip it on your desktop and upload the contents to the `wp-content/plugins/` directory.  When finished you should have a folder for `wp-content/plugins/custom-content-type-manager/`
  1. Activate the plugin from the WordPress manager.

# Activation Errors #

The CCTM runs tests as it is activated to determine whether or not it can run on your WordPress installation. See the [Requirements](Requirements.md) to ensure that your system can safely run the CCTM.
