This is an open-source project, so the documentation, the tutorials, and even the code itself is a labor of love.  We know that it is not perfect, but we have strived to make this code that is worthwhile to use.  Your  [financial contributions](Donations.md) make this happen.

We cannot guarantee a response on any issue! If you require support, I can draft a retainer agreement to support you or your company for a competitive rate.
