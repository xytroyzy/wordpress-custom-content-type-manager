When you first install the CCTM plugin, no custom fields are defined.  By defining a custom field, you are establishing a reusable field that can appear on any content type.

The workflow goes something like this:

  1. Create a Custom Field (click the **Custom Content Types --> Custom Fields** menu item)
  1. Choose the type of field.  For example, are you creating a [Checkbox](Checkbox.md) or a [Dropdown](Dropdown.md)?
  1. Define the field: different types of fields have different options, but in general, you give it a name, a label, and a description, then **Save the field**.
  1. Once you've defined a field, you must choose where that field will be displayed: does it belong to one content type or another?  Or to both.  You can manage the [field associations](FieldAssociations.md) in two places:
    * Custom Content Types --> Custom Fields --> Edit
    * Custom Content Types --> Custom Content Types --> Manage Custom Fields
