Starting with version 0.9.5, you can configure the search parameters that define which posts are available for selection in a relation, image, or media field.

# Simple Search Parameters #

When you define a relation custom field, note that there is a button for "Search Parameters".  When you click it, you get a thickbox that allows you to control which posts are available for selection in your posts and pages that use that custom field.

When you click that button, you get the form that will define which posts are available for selection in your custom field.

# Customizing the Search Form #

What if you don't see the filters that you require?  You will be glad to know that this form is built according to a configuration file, and you can override the default configurations by writing your own configuration file.

See the instructions for [customizing the post selector](Config_post_selector_relation.md).
